# AR Furniture World üåç

**AR Furniture World** is an innovative Augmented Reality (AR) app built with Flutter using the `ar_flutter_plugin`. The app allows users to upload photos to Firebase, automatically removes the background of the photos using the [remove.bg API](https://www.remove.bg/pricing), and provides the ability to dynamically adjust the size, position, and rotation of objects in an AR environment.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Augmented Reality (AR)**: Leverage Flutter‚Äôs `ar_flutter_plugin` to display objects in AR space, allowing immersive 3D experiences.
- **Firebase Integration**: Users can seamlessly upload photos to Firebase for storage and processing.
- **Background Removal**: Automatically remove the background from uploaded images using the [remove.bg API](https://www.remove.bg/pricing), turning any photo into a clean, background-free object for AR placement.
- **Object Manipulation**: Users can dynamically resize, rotate, and move objects in real-time within the AR space.
- **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly interface to upload images, manage AR objects, and control their placement in the real world.
